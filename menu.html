			<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
			<p>This is a world famous game, I don't think you have ever played this game.</p>
			<p>If you hear about it for the first time, I will explain how to play. The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
				<li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
				<li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I don't think it is very hard and you can learn how to play it easily.</p>

			<h1>Tic-toe</h1>
			<p>It is too a famous game. You played this games, when you was a child.</p>
			<p>Tic-toe, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. </p>
			<p>There is a  <a href="./tic-toe/index.html">link</a>.</p>
			<p>In my realization there is no cool design, so if you can help me, please call me by <a href="https:t.me/armashkashka">telegram</a>.</p>
